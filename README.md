# Routing tutorial

This repository contains routing examples using `r5r` with data for Glasgow in the UK. 

The training scripts are `R/03_detailed_itineraries.R` which walks learners through fundamentals of multi-modal routing. 
The activities in `R/04_od_matrices.R` implement a single origin travel matrix, and an all to all travel matrix example.

The rest of scripts in `R/` folder, are necessary for preprocessing input data.
